## Sample Chapter

### Chapter: "Luna and the Missing Dream"

*One night, as she always did, Luna was wandering through the dream fields, keeping an eye out for lost dreams. When she found one, she'd guide it back to its rightful owner, lulling them back to sleep with her soft wool and gentle baas. However, this night was different. Tonight, she had come across a dreamless child, and couldn't find her dream anywhere! She looked high and low, but the dream was nowhere to be found. Luna couldn't lose another job! She had to find the missing dream.*

This chapter introduces readers to Lunaâ€™s world, where dreams are as fragile as they are powerful. Itâ€™s a gentle yet captivating tale about responsibility, empathy, and the search for something precious that has been lost.
